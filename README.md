## üéØ Project Title:
**OpenAgent-Lite: A Goal-Driven Desktop Automation Assistant**

## üßæ Objective:
Create an open-source agentic AI assistant in Python that can automate desktop tasks using natural language input. The assistant should understand goals, break them into subtasks, and perform actions autonomously‚Äîserving as an open alternative to traditional RPA tools.

---

## Technologies & Tools:
- Language: Python 3.10+
- Automation Libraries: `pyautogui`, `selenium` or `playwright`, `schedule`
- LLM Tools: `ollama`, `transformers`, or lightweight local models
- Optional Enhancements: `speechrecognition`, `pyttsx3` for voice interaction

---

## Key Features to Implement:
- A CLI or basic web UI to input tasks/goals in English.
- Task breakdown using a small local LLM (e.g., via Ollama).
- Automate actions: opening applications, clicking, typing, scheduling.
- Save task execution logs and maintain basic task memory.
- Clear documentation and code hosted on GitHub.

---

## Example Use Cases:
- ‚ÄúOpen browser and download all PDF files from a website.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúRename all `.jpg` files in a folder to `holiday_1.jpg`, `holiday_2.jpg`, etc.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúSend an email with today‚Äôs attendance file every day at 6 PM.‚Äù
